Building (If you want to):
I built it with Visual studio 2022 and .NET SDK 8.0.313 installed.

Requirements:
I'm not copletely sure about system requirements to run it. (I guess you will need .NET 8.0 Runtime or newer?)

Usage:
0. Just unzip and run FSMExpress.exe
1. File>Open scene list
2. Navigate into ...\Blue Prince\BLUE PRINCE_Data\ and click Select Folder
3. Select scene from list
For FSMs in the main game level I use (level 2) and for room FSMs I use (sharedassets2.assets)
4. Select FSM from list (It just gives you a huge list of FSMs, you will have to figure out the name yourself, you can start typing letters to filter results)
5. Click on a state to view some methods + parameters that are called inside (Sometimes it doesn't display some objects and variable names and just shows null, so it isn't perfect)

The other options for opening I couldn't make work or I don't know how to use properly.
